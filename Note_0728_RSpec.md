RSpec
======

* Pending --- When the test are run, the test framework will ignore the test.

* Set-Up and After --- Allow us to set-up a specific state for our test to run, and to then cleanup that state after the test has run

* Context Blocks --- You can use it every where you would use describe.

* Stubs ---Use this to creat a fake version of an existing object and to have it rerun a pre-determined value.

* Constecutive Return Values --- We can indicate a different return value each time the stub is called by specifing mutiple arguments to the `and_return` method.
